# SpyPlanet
SpyPlanet is a GUI for exoplanet detection based on modules like Lightkurve and Exoplanet, that i developed for my undergraduate thesis.
It uses photometry and the transit method to detect exoplanets from TESS and Kepler Data.
It can also use MCMC to determine a variety of exoplanet parameters like radius, mass, semi-major axis etc.
